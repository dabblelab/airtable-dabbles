# Airtable Dabbles

This repository contains code examples for working with data in [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/X76erYjM).

## Getting Started

All of the examples assume you have the following.

**1. An Airtable Account**

You'll need at least a [free Airtable account](https://airtable.com/invite/r/X76erYjM) for most of the examples. If any examples require a paid account that will be noted.

**2. An Airtable API Key**

After you have have an Airtable account you can [find your API key under your account settings](https://airtable.com/account).

It will look something like this `keykxPu3xx1Yx38kx`.
